# Motorcycle Price Prediction
This project involves developing a predictive model for estimating the selling price of used vehicles based on factors like kilometers driven and the ex-showroom price. The dataset includes key features such as name, year, seller_type, owner, km_driven, ex_showroom_price, and selling_price. After data preprocessing, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and imputation, we applied various regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest) to predict the selling price. The Random Forest model showed the best performance with the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The trained model was then saved and integrated into a Plumber API, which allows users to input vehicle parameters and receive real-time predictions of the selling price. The API is designed for easy access via HTTP requests, making it a scalable solution for predicting used vehicle prices.
